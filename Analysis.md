Test a Perceptual Phenomenon 

Analyzing the Stroop EffectPerform the analysis in the space below. Remember to follow the instructions (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OkpZLjG_kX9J6LIQ5IltsqMzVWjh36QpnP2RYpVdPU/pub? embedded=True) and review the project rubric (https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/71/view) before submitting. Once you've completed the analysis and write up, download this file as a PDF or HTML file and submit in the next section.(1) What is the independent variable? What is the dependent variable?Independant variable is weather or not the color and words are the same and dependant is time taken to read the list(2) What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.Null Hypothesis: H0 = H0: There is no significant difference in time for the population to state the colors of the words in a congruent or incongruent condition. i.e μcongruent = μincongruentAlternate Hypothesis:H1 = There is a significant difference in time for the population to state the colors of the words in a congruent or incongruent condition. i.e μcongruent != μincongruentWe will do a t test as the population standard deviation is unknown , we are comparing the means of two groups that are dependent and the same subject is doing the each test. We are assuming the sample is normally distributed. The participants are fairly random and we are trying to get an idea of population behavior by sample behavior.(3) Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability. The name of the data file is 'stroopdata.csv'.In [31]: import pandas as pd import numpy as npdata      https://viewda7d0d70.udacity-student-workspaces.com/nbconvert/html/Test%20a%20Perceptual%20Phenomenon.ipynb?download=falsePage 1 of 5

Test a Perceptual Phenomenon 24/03/18, 1*21 AM In [29]: data.plot.box()Out[29]: <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7ffa0d20cef0>Here we see that for all the samples incongruent took more time than congruent from plot 1. It has also much larger spikes. From 2 we see that the lower outliers of incongruent are still above the mean of congruent.(5) Now, perform the statistical test and report the results. What is the confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?  In [43]:In [45]:In [48]:from scipy import stats from math import *m1=data['Congruent'].mean()m2=data['Incongruent'].mean()s1=data['Congruent'].std()s2=data['Incongruent'].std()n=241.0ndata = data.copy()ndata['diff'] = abs(ndata['Congruent'] - ndata['Incongruent'])std = ndata['diff'].std()/(sqrt(n))t = ndata['diff'].mean()/stdprint(t)8.02070694411  https://viewda7d0d70.udacity-student-workspaces.com/nbconvert/html/Test%20a%20Perceptual%20Phenomenon.ipynb?download=falsePage 4 of 5
Test a Perceptual Phenomenon 24/03/18, 1*21 AMThis has a P-Value(2-tail) of 0.00000004103000587. This since p<0.5 we reject the H0 and accept H1.Yes this is the expected result as we inferred this easily from the graphs. This is also logical as our brain does get confused on these tests.
